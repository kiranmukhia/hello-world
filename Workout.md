## Warmup

A great warmup routine should target all major muscle groups in your body to improve flexibility and prepare you for your workout. Here's a comprehensive warmup routine that effectively targets your entire body:

### Neck Rotations:

- Start by sitting or standing tall with your shoulders relaxed.
- Slowly rotate your head to the right, bringing your chin towards your shoulder. Hold for 5 seconds.
- Repeat on the other side, rotating your head to the left.
- Perform 5-10 repetitions on each side.

### Arm Circles:

- Extend your arms out to the sides, parallel to the ground.
- Make small circles forward with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles.
- Reverse the direction and make small circles backward with your arms.
- Perform 10-15 repetitions in each direction.

### Torso Twists:

- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms extended out to the sides.
- Keeping your hips and legs stationary, twist your torso to the right, bringing your right hand towards your back.
- Hold for 5 seconds, then twist to the left, bringing your left hand towards your back.
- Perform 10-15 repetitions on each side.

### Leg Swings Forward and Backward:

- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
- Swing your right leg forward, keeping your leg straight. \* \* Hold for 5 seconds.
- Bring your leg back down and swing your left leg forward.
- Perform 10-15 repetitions on each side.
- Repeat the same motion, swinging your legs backward.

### Knee Lifts:

- Stand with your feet hip-width apart.
- Bring your right knee up towards your chest, grabbing your shin or thigh. Hold for 5 seconds.
- Gently lower your right leg back down and repeat with your left leg.
- Perform 10-15 repetitions on each side.

### Quad Stretches:

- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
- Bend your right leg, bringing your heel towards your buttocks.
- Grasp your ankle or the bottom of your foot and gently pull your heel towards your buttocks.
- Hold for 20-30 seconds.
- Switch legs and repeat on the other side.

### Hamstring Stretches:

- Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
- Reach towards your toes, keeping your back straight.
- Hold for 20-30 seconds.
- Slowly bend your back forward, reaching further towards your toes.
- Hold for another 20-30 seconds.

### Calf Stretches:

- Stand facing a wall with your right hand placed on the wall for balance.
- Step your left leg back, keeping your heel on the ground.
- Lean forward, bending your right knee and keeping your left leg straight.
- Feel a stretch in your left calf.
- Hold for 20-30 seconds.
- Switch legs and repeat on the other side.

### Triceps

     Long head.
     Lateral head.
     Medial head.

Along with the biceps, it enables extension and retraction of the forearm. When the triceps are contracted, the forearm extends and the elbow straightens; if the triceps are relaxed and the biceps flexed, the forearm retracts and the elbow bends.

The triceps also serve to stabilize the shoulder joint at the top of the humerus.

Long Head (Below and extends up to arm):
Tricep Push away

## Pull

The back comprises the Traps and Lats. In addition, we have a few which is depicted in this image,

### Lats

Latissimus dorsi is a climbing muscle. With the arms fixed above the head, it can raise the trunk upwards, together with the help of pectoralis major. It is an important muscle in rowing, swimming (especially during the downstroke) and chopping. The muscle is also active in violent expiration, as it attaches to the ribs. During a cough or sneeze, the muscle can be felt pressing forcibly inward, as it acts to compress the thorax and abdomen. The muscle assists in holding the scapula against the thorax during upper limb movements.

The rhomboids are located underneath the trapezius muscles in the upper back. The rhomboids are responsible for retracting the scapula (shoulder blades) and rotating them downward, while the trapezius is responsible for elevating the scapula, rotating the scapula upward and laterally, and adducting and abducting the scapula.

### Trapezius (Traps)

The trapezius muscle acts as both a posture stabilizer and a movement muscle. Common actions you may recognize that involve the trapezius include shrugging your shoulders, tilting, turning and extending your neck, and keeping your shoulder blades down your back.

Superior Trapezius (Upper):
Barbell Shrugs
Upright Rows
Middle Trapezius (Medial):
Rack Pulls
Face Pulls
Inferior Trapezius (Lower):
Reverse Flys
Band Pull Aparts

Barbell Upright row
Dumbbell shrug

### Biceps

The biceps helps to bend the elbow joint, bringing the lower arm towards the upper arm. This movement is important for activities such as lifting, carrying, and climbing. The biceps muscle also helps to rotate the forearm so that the palm faces upwards. This movement is important for activities such as turning a doorknob or holding a cup. The biceps muscle helps to stabilize the shoulder joint by attaching to the scapula (shoulder blade) and helping to keep the arm in place when it is being used for activities such as lifting or throwing. The biceps muscle helps to maintain good posture by pulling the shoulder blade down and inwards; helping to keep the shoulders from slumping forward.

### Legs

Quadriceps

Quadriceps (Front of thigh) or quads, consist of four muscles. They are:
rectus femoris: This muscle runs straight down your thigh and helps with knee and hip flexion.
vastus medialis: This muscle's function is to extend your knee joint and help stabilize your kneecap.
vastus lateralis: The largest of the four quad muscles, it connects your thigh bone to your kneecap.
vastus intermedius: Along with other muscles in your knee, the vastus intermedius facilitates knee extension.
Hamstrings
Well conditioned and flexible hamstring muscles are very important to athletes to stabilize the knees and prevent hamstring pain and hamstring injury.

The posterior upper leg muscles provide your knees with mobility (extension, flexion and rotation) and strength. They work closely with your quadriceps muscles at the front of your thigh, your gluteal muscles, and your calf muscles to ensure proper movement of your leg and hip.

Your hamstring muscles control movement of your torso, hips and knees, help turn your legs in and out, and are involved with power activities that include a lot of propulsion, thrust and control (such as jumping, climbing, and running). They allow your knee to bend (flex the leg at the knee) and pull your leg backward while propelling your body forward when you move (your thigh straightens and extends the leg back at the hip). They are involved with eccentric movements, which increase the length of the muscle while it is under tension - instead of starting an action, the muscles act as a brake to stop an action. You can feel this when walking or running downhill, landing from jumps or performing squats, and when trying to stop quickly after sprinting.

(Hamstring - Back of thigh)
The lateral hamstring is the biceps femoris. The medial hamstrings are the semitendinosus and the semimembranosus. The tendons for these muscles begin at your ischial tuberosity, or ischium (the bony bump under each buttock), and attach on the outer edges of your shin bones (tibia and fibula) just below the back of your knee.

Biceps Femoris: This is made up of 2 parts - a short head and long head.
Semitendinosus: This joins the sartorius muscle and gracilis muscle at the pes anserinus on the tibia.
Semimembranosus: This is the largest hamstring muscle.

Calves
Your calf muscle supports you when you stand and enables you to move your foot and your lower leg. It propels (pushes) you forward when you walk or run. It also allows you to jump, rotate your ankle, flex your foot and “lock” your knee.

The main muscles in the calf are:
Gastrocnemius:
Soleus:

Calf Raises - Standing Single Leg hold dumbbell in hand
Seated Calf Raise Machine
Glutes

(Bums)
It’s understood that the butt muscles help with hip rotation and extension. Both these functions are essential for walking, running, and weight lifting. For example, the glutes play a secondary role in deadlifts.

It’s important for the entire lower body to be strong enough to assist with the lift. If one part of a muscle group fails to take the weight, it falls on the other secondary parts included in the motion. You could injure yourself, or the motion could remain incomplete due to uneven weight distribution.
